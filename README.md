# ZIS-RS
This is a project I did for my final year of high school. It represents a hybrid between a website and program, containing some dynamic user interactions. The goal of this project is to enable an efficient and easy way of managing resources within one hospital system. It was done in HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL.
